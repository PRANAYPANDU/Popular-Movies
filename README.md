Built an Android Application compatable with mobiles as well as tablets(Multi-Pane Layout),as a part of the Google's Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree ,that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.This app utilizes core Android user interface components,fetches recipe information using a web API,handles media loading, verifies the user interfaces with UI tests(Google's Espresso Testing), and integrating third party libraries(ButterKnife for databinding). Also provided a complete user experience with a home screen widget which shows up-to-date data of the last visted recipe
